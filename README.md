# Atelier API
## Ratings and Reviews
A scalable, RESTful API serving an e-commerce site.

 I was given 4 CSV files with a total of 31 million entires, the data behind the Ratings & Reviews section of an e-commerce website. The goal of this project was to pair this API with the site's front-end, replacing its legacy API and improving site performance.
